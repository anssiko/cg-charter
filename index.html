      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
      Community Group (CG)</a> explores the use of secondary screens from Web
      pages.  We propose that this Community Group incubate and develop
      specifications and prototypes of network protocols that implement
      the <a href= "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation
      API</a>.
      </p>
    <p>
      This work has three primary purposes:
    </p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Enable interoperability among implementations of the Presentation
        API.</em>  A user agent that implements the proposed specifications
        should be able to act as
        a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-controlling-user-agent">controlling
        user agent</a> or
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-receiving-user-agent">receiving
        user agent</a> for another user agent that implements the same
        specifications.  Interoperability among controllers and receivers will
        increase the number of opportunities for the Presentation API to be
        used.  Interoperability will also create more uniform and predictable
        API behavior across browsers, encouraging adoption of the Presentation
        API by Web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Encourage implementation of the Presentation API by browser
        vendors.</em>  The proposed specifications should reduce the design work
        required to implement the Presentation API in a browser.  Ideally,
        browser vendors will be able to incorporate any prototype implementation
        directly into their products to experiment and iterate on stability and
        performance, and provide feedback to the group on the proposed
        specifications.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Establish complementary specifications for the Presentation
        API.</em>  The Presentation API, by nature of its scope, leaves many
        network details up to the implementation.  This includes how
        presentation displays are discovered, how presentations are started,
        connected, and stopped, and how the controller and receiver communicate.
        The proposed specifications will provide details on how the
        implementation requirements of the Presentation API can be met and
        should clarify issues that are not addressed in the Presentation API
        specification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The scope of work proposed here goes beyond the current <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/charter.html#scope">scope</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working Group
      (WG)</a>.  Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to migrate
      the proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate
      standards track, for example
      the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4">IETF Standards
      Track</a> or
      a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working">W3C Working
      Group</a>, for further contributions and formal standardization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership of the group is open to everybody. Upon joining the group,
      participants agree to the terms of the <a href=

    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the <a href=
      "https://github.com/webscreens/presentation-api/wiki/Second-Screen-Community-Group-Charter">
      previous charter</a>, the Second Screen Community Group (CG) delivered
      the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/presentation-api/20141118/">Presentation
      API Community Group Final Report</a> Specification that provides an API
      for a Web page to display and control content on a secondary screen. The
      work was migrated to the W3C Second Screen Working Group (WG) and the
      Community Group Final Report was provided as input to the <a href=
      "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> that is
      now being developed in the WG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API allows web applications to use secondary screens to
      display Web content. The initiating HTML page can request display of an
      HTML page on the second screen with a messaging channel between the two
      pages to enable communication and control. The two pages can both be
      rendered on the controlling user agent with just the video display sent to
      the second device (1-UA), or the second page can be rendered independently
      on the receiving user agent (2-UA).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API abstracts away the means of connecting as well as
      the underlying communication and video streaming technologies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following tasks are in scope for the work of the community group.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The specification of a set of network protocols that allows one user
        agent to use the Presentation API to discover and present Web content on
        another user agent, when both user agents are connected to the same
        Local Area Network (LAN).
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement of all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
        algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Presentation API are
        in scope.  This includes protocols that preserve the privacy and
        security of data exchanged between the controlling and receiving user
        agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 2-UA mode of the Presentation API is in scope.  In 2-UA mode, the
        receiving user agent renders the presented document independently and
        messages between documents are exchanged via the network.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement of all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
        algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Remote Playback API
        are also in scope, for the specific case of remotely playing
        a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element with a <code>src</code> URL media
        source on a presentation display.
      </li>
      <li>
        The development of open source, prototype implementations of the
        protocols is in scope.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="issue">
      For implementation development, check on licensing requirements for code
      contributions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this community group, the following tasks are out of scope.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Specifications of user agent or presentation display behavior beyond
        what is required to send, receive, and process network data, or to meet
        security, privacy and accessibility requirements for the protocols.  The
        behavior of the user agents when presenting with respect to the Web
        content and the user is defined by the Presentation API.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement 1-UA mode for the Presentation API are not in
        scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that support use of presentation displays connected by
        technologies other than IPv4/IPv6 networks (HDMI, Bluetooth, etc.) are
        not in scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing specifications to implement specific proprietary presentation
        display network protocols such as DIAL, DLNA, Google Cast, MiraCast, or
        Airplay are not in scope.  However, we will investigate mechanisms that
        allow the core protocol to be extended with proprietary or experimental
        features, so that vendors can leverage the discovery, security, and
        connection capabilities of the core protocols.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing protocols that allow interaction between controlling and
        receiving user agents on different local area networks is not in scope.
        However, we will investigate other mechanisms for allowing the core
        protocols to function over WAN networks, such as the use of cloud relay
        services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="issue">
      We should discuss whether supporting 1-UA mode is desirable, feasible and
      in scope for the Community Group. TODO: File GH Issue
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      We should discuss whether extending localization and accessibility support
      across user agents is in scope. TODO: File GH Issue
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      For vendor extensions to protocols, 1-UA mode, and non-LAN use cases, we
      may wish to add some non-normative reports on these topics to the scope of
      work.  TODO: File GH issue

      The Community Group will produce the following specifications.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A specification controlling and receiving user
        agents, <em>Presentation Display Discovery and Connection</em>, that
        will specify how the controlling user agent may find available
        presentation displays (receiving user agents) on the local area network
        and establish two-way communication with them.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user
        agents, <em>Presentation Display Security</em>, that presents a security
        model that provides authentication of the presentation display to the
        user and confidentiality for data exchanged between the controlling user
        agent and the receiving user agent.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user
        agents, <em>Presentation Display Protocol for Remote Rendering</em>,
        that describes how a controlling user agent may start, connect, stop and
        exchange messages with a presentation on a receiving user agent.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user
        agents, <em>Presentation Display Protocol for Remote Playback</em>, that
        describes how a controlling user agent may start and control remote
        playback of a <code>&lt;video&rt;</code> element using
        a <code>src=</code> URL media source.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For conformance, a user agent (controlling or receiving) would be required
      to implement the first, second, and third or fourth specification.

      mechanisms (e.g. pull requests).
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. The
      Editor(s) of a specification will determine and record consensus
      decisions through the specification's GitHub repo issue list with
      assistance from the Community Group Chair(s). Members of the group may reopen issues
      with new technical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the Community Group, and does not
      unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or their
      employer. With that said, the group favours forward motion and dissent
      will not be allowed to block work on a specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and there
      is a call for assessing consensus after due consideration of different
      opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any objections.
      Participants may call for an online vote if they feel the Chair has not
      accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair refuses
      to assess consensus. The call for a vote must specify the duration of the
      vote which must be at least 7 days and should be no more than 14 days.
      The Chair must start the vote within 7 days of the request. The decision
      will be based on the majority of the ballots cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the Editor(s) and Chair(s) are the only Committers. It is
      expected that participants can earn Committer status in a GitHub
      reposiroty through a history of valuable contributions as is common in
      open source projects.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work on its GitHub
      repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure
      contributions can be tracked and to ensure that engagement will scale to
      a large number of proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in the repository issues list. Any group participant may object to a
      decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of
      publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical
      reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try
      to resolve the objection according to the <a href="#decision">Decision
      Process</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
