      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
      Community Group (CG)</a> explores the use of secondary screens from Web
      pages.  We propose that this Community Group incubate and develop proposed
      specifications and implementations of network protocols that implement
      the <a href= "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation
      API</a>.  This work has three primary purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Enable interoperability between vendors and implementations of the
        Presentation API.</em>  Any vendor that implements the proposed specifications should
        be able to act as
        a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-controlling-user-agent">controlling
        user agent</a> or
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-receiving-user-agent">receiving
        user agent</a> for any other vendor.  The expanded footprint of
        interoperable controllers and receivers will increase the number of
        opportunities for the API to be used.  Interoperability will also increase
        the confidence of Web developers in uniform and predictable API behavior
        across browsers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Encourage implementation of the Presentation API by browser
        vendors.</em>  The proposed specifications should reduce the design work
        required to support the Presentation API.  Ideally, vendors will be
        able to incorporate any prototype implementation directly into their
        products to test and iterate on performance and interoperability.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Provide complementary specifications for the Presentation API.</em>.
        The Presentation API, by nature of its scope, leaves many details up to
        the implementation.  This includes how presentation displays are
        discovered, how presentations are started, connected, and stopped, and
        how the controller and receiver communicate.  The proposed
        specifications will provide details on how the requirements of the
        Presentation API can be met and can clarify issues that were not
        addressed in the API specification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The scope of work proposed here goes beyond the current <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/charter.html#scope">scope</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working Group
      (WG)</a>.  Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to migrate
      the proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate
      standards track, for example
      the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4">IETF Standards
      Track</a> or a <a >W3C Working Group</a>, for further contributions and
      formal standardization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership of the group is open to everybody. Upon joining the group,
      participants agree to the terms of the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the <a href=
      "https://github.com/webscreens/presentation-api/wiki/Second-Screen-Community-Group-Charter">
      previous charter</a>, the Second Screen Community Group (CG) delivered
      the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/presentation-api/20141118/">Presentation
      API Community Group Final Report</a> Specification that provides an API
      for a Web page to display and control content on a secondary screen. The
      work was migrated to the W3C Second Screen Working Group (WG) and the
      Community Group Final Report was provided as input to the <a href=
      "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> that is
      now being developed in the WG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API allows web applications to use secondary screens to
      display Web content. The initiating HTML page can request display of an
      HTML page on the second screen with a message channel between the two
      pages to enable communication and control. The two pages can both be
      rendered on the controlling user agent with just the video display sent
      to the second device (1-UA), or the second page can be rendered on the
      receiving user agent (2-UA).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API abstracts away the means of connecting as well as
      the underlying connection technologies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <h2 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this chartering of the CG, the following tasks are out of scope.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developing specifications that support the <a href="">Remote Playback
        API</a>.  This API is at an earlier stage of maturity at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing specifications to support 1-UA mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing specifications to support specific proprietary media sharing
        protocols such as DIAL, DLNA, Google Cast, MiraCast, or Airplay.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="issue">
      We should discuss whether supporting 1-UA mode interop is feasible and in
      scope for the CG.  The challenge is doing it well.  I propose doing this
      once WebRTC has native, high quality screencasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should discuss how to make the protocol extensible for vendor specific
      schemes if they want to leverage lower levels of the specification, while
      preserving interoperability for higher levels.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <p>
      The CG will deliver the following.
      </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The <a href="#specifications">specifications</a> listed below.</li>
      <li>
        A prototype implementation those specifications, published on GitHub or
        an equivalent open source repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        A demonstration of interoperabilty between two or more major browser
        vendors showing use of the specifications produced by this CG to
        implement the Presentation API.
      </li>
      <li>
        A test suite to verify the compliance of an implementation of the
        specifications produced by this CG.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="specifications">
      Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The group will only produce Specifications listed in this
      section</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CG will produce the following specifications.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A specification, <em>Presentation Display Discovery and
        Connection</em>, that will specify how the controlling user agent may
        find available presentation displays and establish two-way communication
        with them.  This specification must meet <a href="">requirements REQ1-REQN</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification, <em>Presentation Display Security Architecture</em>,
        that presents a security model that provides authentication of the
        presentation display and confidentiality for data exchanged between the
        controlling user agent and the display.  This specification must meet 
        <href="">requirement REQ-S</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification, <em>Presentation Display Protocol: 2-UA mode</em>, that
        describes how a controlling user agent may start, connect, stop and
        exchange messages with a presentation rendered by a distinct receiving
        user agent.  This specification must meet <a href="">requirements REQX-REQY</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="note">
      The specification titles are for demonstration purposes in this charter,
      the actual titles may differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add any additional specifications, this Charter must be amended by the
      process described in the <a href="#charter-change">Amendments to the
      Charter</a> section. All deliverables for which the CLA <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/#id3">Patents</a>
      section applies must be designated as such here.

      The CLA <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/#id3">Patents</a>
      section does not apply to Non-Normative Reports. The group may produce
      such reports, as described in the <a href="#scope-of-work">Scope of
      Work</a> section.

      Dependencies or Liaisons
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C
      Working Groups in order to transition specification proposals to the
      Recommendation Track.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This group works closely with the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">W3C Second Screen Working
      Group</a>.
      </li>
      <li>There are no external specifications that must be created before the
      Specification(s) to be developed in this group can be completed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process and Patent Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. Proposals in this Community
      Group charter are applicable "Specification" in the CLA. When people
      request to participate without representing their organization's legal
      interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with
      the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a>. The
      section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes how
      W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make contributions in the GitHub
      repository for the project that they are interested in. This may be in
      the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding
      a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created for proposals in the Community Group must use the
      <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a> and <a href=
      "LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a> files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: this CG will not use a <em>contrib</em> mailing list for
      contributions since all contributions will be tracked via Github
      mechanisms (e.g. pull requests).
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. The
      Editor(s) of a specification will determine and record consensus
      decisions through the specification's GitHub repo issue list with
      assistance from the CG Chair(s). Members of the group may reopen issues
      with new technical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer. With
      that said, the group favours forward motion and dissent will not be
      allowed to block work on a specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and there
      is a call for assessing consensus after due consideration of different
      opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any objections.
      Participants may call for an online vote if they feel the Chair has not
      accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair refuses
      to assess consensus. The call for a vote must specify the duration of the
      vote which must be at least 7 days and should be no more than 14 days.
      The Chair must start the vote within 7 days of the request. The decision
      will be based on the majority of the ballots cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the Editor(s) and Chair(s) are the only Committers. It is
      expected that participants can earn Committer status in a GitHub
      reposiroty through a history of valuable contributions as is common in
      open source projects.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work on its GitHub
      repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure
      contributions can be tracked and to ensure that engagement will scale to
      a large number of proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in the repository issues list. Any group participant may object to a
      decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of
      publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical
      reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try
      to resolve the objection according to the <a href="#decision">Decision
      Process</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
